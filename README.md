# Very WIP Typescript Minecraft Server Software
Basically, i got overbored, and out came this. This is my project now for the next x amount of months and i have no life.

Please note that this is a WIP project, and not being always worked on. Im trying to make the code as readable as possible, tho with Minecrafts Protocol, that can be very tricky.
